Track replies and conversations so you can turn them into actual bookings.

Follow-up rules:

Delay between them (e.g., 5–7 days).

Max outreach per day (to avoid spam and email provider limits).

3. Discovery & Research Features
3.1. Show Discovery

The app:

Searches YouTube for:

Channels, playlists, and videos that match your topics.

Keywords like “podcast”, “interview”, “guest”, “with [Name]”.

Searches podcast directories (via APIs) for:

Shows in relevant categories (spirituality, religion, metaphysics, paranormal, self-help, etc.).

Shows whose descriptions match your topic keywords.

Uses general web search to:

Find show websites or episodes that mention guests and your topics.

3.2. Guest-Focused Filtering

For each show, the app:

Scans episode titles/descriptions for:

“Interview”, “with [Guest]”, “featuring”, “feat.”, “conversation with”, “guest”.

Scores how often episodes have guest-like titles.

Marks shows as:

Guest-heavy (most episodes have guests),

Guest-occasional,

Solo-focused (few or no guests).

You can choose:

“Only shows that regularly have guests.”

Or “Include occasional guest shows.”

3.3. Deduplication & Skipping Repeats

The app must discard and skip repeats at several levels:

Same show appearing in multiple sources:

Merges YouTube channel + podcast feed + website under a single “Show” entry.

Shows you already:

Contacted

Rejected

Booked

Rules:

Each show gets a unique internal ID.

Before adding a new one, the app checks:

URL match

Name similarity

RSS / channel ID

If it’s a repeat:

It doesn’t add a new entry.

It updates the existing show’s info (e.g., latest stats), but does not send another outreach unless you explicitly re-approve.

4. Show Profile: What Each Show Record Includes

5. Automatic Email Outreach
5.1. Personalization Logic

When the app finds a host name (from show site, “Hosted by…”, author field, etc.):

It will use:

If host name exists:
Hello, {{host_name}}!

If no name found:

Fallback to:

Hello there! or Hello, {{show_name}} team!

The app replaces tokens in your email with real data:

{{host_name}} → “Sarah”

{{show_name}} → “Mystic Paths Podcast”

{{your_name}} → “Benton”

{{your_title}} → “a Shaman in the Japanese Shinto tradition”

{{your_main_link}} → your best link (site, docu, book, etc.)

5.2. Sending Behavior

You review a list of “Approved for outreach” shows.

You can:

Select all or some shows.

Confirm sending.

The app:

Sends emails spaced out (e.g., a few minutes apart) to avoid looking like a spam blast.

Respects a daily limit you set.

Logs:

Send time

Email subject/body used

Which template version (if you have multiple)

5.3. Follow-ups

If you choose to:

Follow-up #1:

Trigger: no reply after N days.

Uses a shorter template like:

Hi {{host_name}},
Just wanted to follow up on my earlier message about possibly joining you on {{show_name}}…

Follow-up #2:

Trigger: still no reply after another N days.

Optional, very gentle:

If it’s not a fit right now, no worries at all. Thank you for reading.

The app will stop all follow-ups if:

It detects a reply.

The email bounces.

The show is marked as “Do not contact”.

6. Handling Replies From Shows
6.1. Inbox Connection & Sync

To manage replies:

The app connects to your email (via OAuth: e.g., Gmail/Outlook).

It filters emails connected to outreach:

Based on In-Reply-To, subject lines, and email addresses.

Each conversation with a show is:

Attached to that show’s profile.

Displayed as a message thread within the app.

6.2. Auto-Categorization of Replies

The app analyzes replies and tags them:

Positive / Interested:

“We’d love to have you on”, “Let’s schedule”, “This sounds great”

Neutral / Maybe later:

“We’ll keep you in mind”, “Not right now but possible later”

Negative / Not a fit:

“Not interested”, “Our audience isn’t a match”

It then updates show status automatically:

Positive → “Interested”

Neutral → “Maybe later”

Negative → “Not interested”

6.3. Suggested Responses

You still control what you send, but the app can:

Suggest response templates based on reply type:

Example – Positive reply

Tag: “Interested”

Suggested follow-up:

Thank them.

Offer availability.

Share a one-sheet or talking points link.

Status after you send: “Negotiating / Scheduling”

Example – Neutral / Maybe later

Tag: “Maybe later”

App offers:

A light acknowledgment.

Option to set a reminder in X months.

Example – Not interested

Tag: “Not interested”

App offers:

A simple, polite thank-you.

Marks the show as “Do not contact again”.

6.4. Reminders & Tasks

For positive replies, the app can:

Create a task:

“Follow up with Mystic Paths Podcast if no time confirmed by [date].”

Show these tasks on a dashboard:

Today’s follow-ups

This week’s upcoming shows

For fully booked interviews:

Store the date/time of recording.

Optionally sync to your personal calendar (Google, etc.).

7. Workflow States (Your “Guest Funnel”)

Each show moves through clear stages:

Discovered

Found by the system, not yet reviewed.

Qualified

You approve it (relevant, active, good fit).

Pitched

First outreach email sent.

Follow-up

Auto (or manual) follow-up email(s) sent if no response.

Responded: Interested

They want to talk more or book you.

Booked

Recording date scheduled.

Published (optional)

You add the episode link once it’s live.

Archived / Not a fit

You don’t want to contact them again, or they said no.

You can always see:

Counts per stage.

Conversion rates (e.g., “10% of pitched shows reply positively”).

8. Controls for Quality & Safety

To make the app actually successful (and not just spammy):

Relevance Filters:

Minimum activity (e.g., last episode within 3 months).

Minimum episode count (e.g., 10+).

Topic match score threshold (e.g., at least 70/100).

Compliance & Respect:

One outreach sequence per show maximum, unless you manually restart.

Easy way to mark “This show requested no more emails.”

Clear setting to disable auto-follow-ups if you prefer to handle them manually.

Review Queue:

Before sending anything, you can:

Scan the list

Deselect any shows that feel off-brand

Edit details per show (e.g., tweak note: “They did an episode on Japanese folklore”)

9. Analytics & Feedback Loop

To help you improve over time, the app can show:

Per-topic performance:

How many positive replies for “Shinto” vs “general spirituality” vs “healing”.

Best template performance:

If you use multiple email templates, see which one gets more responses.

Show type success:

YouTube-only vs audio-only podcasts.

Small vs large shows.

This helps you refine:

Your topics.

Your messaging.

The type of shows you target.
