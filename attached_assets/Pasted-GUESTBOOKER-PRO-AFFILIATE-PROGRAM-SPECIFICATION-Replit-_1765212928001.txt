GUESTBOOKER PRO — AFFILIATE PROGRAM SPECIFICATION (Replit-Ready)

This is the full blueprint for your affiliate system.

1. Affiliate Program Overview

GuestBooker Pro will allow users and non-users to earn 20–30% recurring monthly commission for every customer they refer.

Affiliates receive commissions as long as their referred customer remains subscribed.

2. Commission Structure
Default Commission:

20% recurring monthly

High-Performing Affiliates (optional):

200+ referred MRR: 25%

500+ referred MRR: 30%

These tiers are optional but recommended for scaling.

3. How Affiliate Tracking Works
Each affiliate gets:

a unique referral ID

a unique referral link

Example:

https://guestbookerpro.com/?ref=AFF12345

When a user visits using this link:

Store the affiliate ID in a cookie for 90 days

If the visitor creates an account, associate the new user with the affiliateID

If the user subscribes, generate commission entries

Cookie requirements:

Duration: 90 days

Renewal: each visit resets the 90-day countdown

Must persist across sign-up flow

4. Database Structure
Affiliate table

  id: String,
  userId: String,        // if affiliate is a customer
  commissionRate: Number, // 0.20, 0.25, or 0.30

  amount: Number,

}

5. Commission Logic
When a referred user subscribes:

Calculate commission:
commission = userMonthlyPrice * affiliateCommissionRate

Recurring payments:

Each month, when Stripe or LemonSqueezy processes billing:

Check if the user is still active

Create a new commission record

Add to the affiliate's pending commissions

If the user cancels subscription:

Commissions stop automatically

Past commissions remain payable

6. Payout Rules
Minimum payout threshold:

$50

Payout frequency:

Monthly

Payout method:

Wise

Stripe Connect (optional, advanced)

Payout processing:
