2. Core Rule: Search Results Must Equal Email Limits

Every tier must guarantee that search results and email send capacity match.

Example:

If a user has 500 emails/month, they must receive at least 500 show results/month.

This prevents a user from paying for 500 emails but only getting 50 shows.

3. Technical Implementation of Search Limits
Option Used: Monthly Search Pool (recommended)

Each user has a monthly pool of allowed search results equal to their email limit.

searchPool = {
  basic: 100,
  growth: 500,
  pro: 1000,
  agency: 10000
};

When the user searches:

Determine their tier

Subtract the number of results returned from their remaining pool

Prevent searches if pool = 0

Reset monthly via cron

Backend logic:
const tier = user.subscriptionTier;
const limitRemaining = user.searchRemaining;

// Get all results from AI
const results = fullResults.slice(0, limitRemaining);

// Deduct from pool
user.searchRemaining -= results.length;
user.save();

return results;

4. Monthly Email Limits Implementation

Store email limits alongside search limits:

emailLimits = {
  basic: 100,
  growth: 500,
  pro: 1000,
  agency: 10000
};


Each time a user sends an email:

Check their remaining quota

Block sending if quota is zero

Show upgrade modal

Reset both counters monthly.

5. CRM Rules by Tier
Basic

show name

show email

status only (new, contacted, replied, booked)

Growth

includes notes

includes custom tags

Pro

adds activity history:

email sent timestamps

follow-up schedule

reply log

Agency

team-wide CRM

lead assignment

shared notes

shared activity logs

6. Follow-Up Automation Rules
Basic

No automation

UI should show locked features with “Upgrade to unlock” messaging

Growth

Single automated follow-up after X days

User sets delay (1–30 days)

Pro

Multi-step sequences (e.g., 3 follow-ups)

Users can customize each step

Agency

Unlimited sequences

Assign follow-ups to team members

7. Tier-Based UI Visibility

Frontend must check user tier before rendering features:

{userTier !== "basic" && <AutoFollowUpSettings />}
{userTier === "pro" && <MultiSequenceSettings />}
{userTier === "agency" && <TeamManagement />}


If restricted:

Show modal: “This feature is available on the Growth plan and above.”

8. Team Account Logic (Agency Tier)

Agency accounts must be implemented as:

Parent account

Holds the quota

Shares CRM

Manages users

Sub-accounts (3–10)

Use the same CRM

Connect their own Gmail

Draw from the same email + search pool

Database structure example
{
  ownerId: "user123",
  teamMembers: ["user456", "user789", ...],
  sharedCRM: true,
  emailRemaining: 10000,
  searchRemaining: 10000
}

9. Annual Billing Implementation

Calculate as:

annualPrice = monthlyPrice * 12 * 0.9


Store in DB:

billingFrequency: "monthly" | "annual"


Bill via Stripe or LemonSqueezy.

10. Upgrade Modals (copy/paste text)

“You’ve reached your monthly outreach limit.
