1. Pricing & Plans – What the System Needs to Support

You’re basically running this as a SaaS app. It should support:

Multiple plans (e.g. Starter / Pro / Agency)

Two billing cycles:

Monthly (default)

Yearly with 10% discount vs. paying 12 months

Recurring subscriptions:

Auto-bill every month or year

Save payment method securely

One-off purchases or add-ons (if you want later):

Extra outreach credits, etc.

2. Admin: Full Control Over Prices (Fixing “I cannot change the prices”)

Right now you said: “I cannot change the prices in admin.”
The requirement: you must be able to.

2.1. Admin Pricing Panel

Inside the admin dashboard, there should be a Pricing & Plans section where you can:

Create / edit / delete plans, each with:

Plan name: “Starter”, “Pro”, “Agency”, etc.

Description

Features:

Max outreach emails / month

Max saved shows

Number of user seats, etc.

Base monthly price (e.g. $29)

Automatically computed or editable yearly price:

Yearly = monthly_price * 12 * 0.9 (10% off)
or you set it manually, but app shows what 10% off would be so you know.

Toggle:

Active / inactive (so you can hide old plans)

2.2. Price Changes Behavior

When you change a price:

Future sign-ups see the new prices immediately.

Existing subscribers can:

Stay on old pricing (grandfathered) OR

Be auto-switched going forward (you choose this behavior in admin).

Admin panel shows:

Current plan prices

Historical changes (optional log, helpful for clarity)

3. Payment Methods: Where They Live and How They Attach to Prices

You asked:

“I also need a place to put the payment methods and have those attach to the main prices.”

3.1. Payment Methods in Admin

Admin should have a Payments & Gateways section where you can:

Connect providers like:

Credit/debit cards (via Stripe, etc.)

PayPal

Maybe bank transfer or others later

For each provider:

On/off toggle

Display name (what users see, e.g. “Pay with card”)

Any fees or rules specific to that method (if you need to show that)

The app then knows:

Which payment methods are available for each plan.

Default method if multiple are active.

3.2. Payment Methods for Users

On the user side (billing page):

Users can:

Add a payment method (card, etc.)

Set a default payment method

Remove or update methods (if not tied to an active subscription, or after adding a new one)

These stored methods are what the app uses to:

Charge monthly

Charge the yearly amount

Apply future charges automatically

4. Shopping Cart: How It Should Work

You said:

“Shopping card needs to implement and work.”

Think of this as a simple cart specialized for subscriptions, not a big e-commerce store.

4.1. Cart Behavior

User clicks “Get Started” or “Upgrade to Pro”.

The cart shows:

Selected plan: e.g. Pro

Billing cycle:

Monthly price (e.g. $29 / month)

OR Yearly price with clear 10% savings:
“$313 / year (10% off vs $348)”

If you add one-off items later (like “+1000 extra outreach emails”), they also appear in cart.

4.2. Cart Summary

Cart displays:

Plan name

Billing cycle (Monthly or Yearly)

Price breakdown:

Base price

10% discount shown for yearly (either as a separate line or baked in with a note)

Total due now

Recurring amount:

“Renews at $29/month” or “Renews at $313/year”

User then proceeds to Checkout.

5. Subscriptions: Monthly & Yearly With 10% Discount
5.1. Monthly Subscription

When user chooses Monthly:

The system:

Charges the first month immediately.

Creates a subscription with:

Next billing date = today + 1 month.

Uses their saved/default payment method automatically.

5.2. Yearly Subscription (10% Off)

When user chooses Yearly:

System:

Computes yearly price = monthly_price * 12 * 0.9.

Charges full year up front.

Sets:

Next billing date = today + 1 year.

Interface must clearly show:

Regular 12-month cost vs discounted yearly:

“$29/month OR $313/year (10% off)”

5.3. Upgrades / Downgrades Between Plans

Scenarios:

Monthly → Higher monthly plan

Upgrade takes effect immediately.

Optionally pro-rate (partial charge for the rest of the month).

Monthly → Yearly

Can either:

Start yearly from today, using pro-rated credit from remaining monthly time,

Or start yearly when current month ends (cleaner messaging).

Yearly → Monthly

Typically apply at the end of the current paid year (no refund, just change renewal behavior).

Plan Downgrade

Takes effect at next billing date to avoid messy feature changes mid-cycle.

All this should be configurable in Admin policies:

“Prorate on upgrade: Yes/No”

“Downgrades effective date: now / next cycle”

6. Saving Payment Methods for Recurring Billing

You said:

“Save to collect monthly subscriptions.”

Behavior:

When user completes checkout for a subscription:

Their payment method is securely saved as a “billing method”.

Subscription is linked to that method.

For recurring charges:

On renewal date, system automatically:

Charges the saved method.

Updates subscription status.

If a charge fails:

System:

Retries (e.g. after 1 day, then 3 days, etc.).

Flags payment issue on user account.

Sends email: “Update your payment method to keep your subscription active.”

7. Billing & Receipts

To make this professional and trackable:

For every successful charge:

Generate a receipt with:

Plan name

Period covered (e.g., Nov 16–Dec 15)

Amount charged

Payment method (e.g. last 4 digits of card)

Email the receipt to the user.

User’s Billing History page:

List of all charges, dates, amounts.

Download receipts as PDF (optional).

8. Cancellation & Renewal Logic
8.1. User Cancels

When a user cancels:

Subscription is set to:

“Canceled – pending end of current term”

They:

Keep access until the paid period ends.

Renewal:

No further charges after end date.

Status updates to “Expired”.

8.2. Admin Cancel / Pause

Admin can:

Cancel a subscription immediately.

Pause a subscription:

Temporarily stop recurring billing.

User may or may not retain access (decided by policy).

9. Tying It All Back to the Outreach Features

Each plan tier can control what the app does:

Starter:

e.g., 200 outreach emails/month

Basic search & list features

Pro:

e.g., 1,000 outreach emails/month

Multi-topic campaigns

Automatic follow-ups

Agency:

Multi-user accounts

Higher limits

Priority support

The app should:

Check the user’s active plan.

Enforce the limits per billing period.

Reset monthly usage numbers on each monthly/annual renewal.
