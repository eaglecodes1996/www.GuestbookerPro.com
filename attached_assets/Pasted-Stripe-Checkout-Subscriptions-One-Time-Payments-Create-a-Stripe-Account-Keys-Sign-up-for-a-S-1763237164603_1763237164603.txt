Stripe Checkout (Subscriptions & One‑Time Payments)

Create a Stripe Account & Keys

Sign up for a Stripe account and obtain your publishable key (for the client) and secret key (for your server).

Define Products and Prices

Create your product and associated price(s) in the Stripe dashboard or via the API. You’ll need these when you create a Checkout Session.

Create a Checkout Session on Your Server

Build an endpoint (e.g., /create-checkout-session) that calls the Stripe API to create a Checkout Session.

Set the mode parameter according to the type of payment: payment for one‑time charges, subscription for recurring plans, or setup to save payment details
docs.stripe.com
.

Provide a return URL in the session creation request so Stripe knows where to redirect users after the payment attempt
docs.stripe.com
. Include {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} in the URL so your app can retrieve the session on return.

The API returns a client_secret which your client will use to complete the payment
docs.stripe.com
.

Build the Client-Side Checkout Page

Load Stripe.js from https://js.stripe.com on your checkout page to remain PCI compliant
docs.stripe.com
.

Initialize Stripe with your publishable key and use the Payment Element or prebuilt Checkout to render the payment form.

When your user submits the payment, call stripe.confirm() with the client_secret. Handle errors and show success or failure messages.

After payment, redirect the user to your return page and use the session ID to check the payment status via your server.

🟢 PayPal Subscriptions (Recurring Payments)

Get Developer Credentials

Log in to PayPal’s developer dashboard and obtain your Client ID, access token, business account credentials, and personal (test) account credentials
developer.paypal.com
.

Create a Product

Use the Catalog Products REST API to create a product representing your service. The request includes a name, description, type and other details. A successful response returns a product id that you’ll use in the next step
developer.paypal.com
.

Create a Subscription Plan

With the product ID, call the Subscriptions REST API to create a plan.

Define billing cycles (trial and recurring cycles), pricing details, setup fees, tax, and failure behaviour. The API returns a plan id
developer.paypal.com
.

Embed the PayPal Subscription Button

Add the PayPal JavaScript SDK to your webpage:

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&vault=true&intent=subscription"></script>
<div id="paypal-button-container"></div>
<script>
  paypal.Buttons({
    createSubscription: function(data, actions) {
      return actions.subscription.create({
        plan_id: 'YOUR_PLAN_ID'
      });
    },
    onApprove: function(data, actions) {
      alert('You have successfully subscribed to ' + data.subscriptionID);
    }
  }).render('#paypal-button-container');
</script>


Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with the Client ID from your developer dashboard and YOUR_PLAN_ID with the plan ID returned by the Create Plan API
developer.paypal.com
.

When a user clicks the button, PayPal creates the subscription and handles the payment flow. On success, you can show a confirmation message or redirect to your thank‑you page.

🧾 Key Points for Checkout Integration

Server-side Logic: All sensitive operations (creating sessions, products, and plans) must be performed on the server using your secret API keys or access tokens. Never expose secret keys to the client.

Return/Success URLs: Both Stripe and PayPal require that you specify where to redirect users after a payment or subscription. Make sure these pages are implemented on your site.

Testing: Use the sandbox/test modes offered by PayPal and Stripe to validate your integration before going live.

Security: Always load external scripts from the official domains (js.stripe.com for Stripe and paypal.com/sdk/js for PayPal)
docs.stripe.com
developer.paypal.com
.

Subscription vs. One‑Time: Stripe’s Checkout supports one‑time and recurring payments; set mode accordingly
docs.stripe.com
. PayPal’s subscription buttons handle recurring payments; for one‑time payments you can use the PayPal Checkout flow instead.
