🧑‍🎤 Guest vs. Influencer Profiles

Users can now choose from two profile types:

Guest Profile
For speakers who want to be interviewed on podcasts or shows. Tailored toward finding host‑driven formats (e.g., podcasts that feature guest interviews).

Influencer Profile
Designed for creators seeking video collaborations, cross‑channel appearances, or co‑productions rather than formal interviews. The discovery engine emphasizes channels open to collaborative content (e.g., dual live streams, guest co‑hosts, or guest vlog appearances).

Both types allow:

A customized bio, keywords, and minimum audience size.

Unlimited discovery (thousands of shows) and unlimited email outreach.

Separate pipelines and follow‑up schedules per profile.

🗃️ Central Show Database & Discovery Flow

Site‑Wide Show Cache
Every show you discover or manually add is stored in a shared database accessible by the entire platform. If a show has already been scanned and approved for another user, it doesn’t require another external API call. This dramatically reduces repeated searches and speeds up discovery.

Discovery Prioritization

Check the internal database for relevant shows that match a user’s keywords, subscriber range, activity status, and profile type (Guest or Influencer).

If no matches are found, run a new external search via the Podcast Index API and YouTube API. Results are added to both the user’s list and the shared database automatically.

Filter & merge duplicates so that users don’t accidentally reach out to the same show multiple times.

This internal caching system ensures faster results and reduces unnecessary API usage.
